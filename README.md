### Video Quality Levels
The application automatically generates the following quality levels:

#### Landscape Videos:
- 256x144 @ 150k bitrate
- 426x240 @ 200k bitrate  
- 640x360 @ 300k bitrate
- 854x480 @ 500k bitrate
- 1280x720 @ 1000k bitrate
- 1920x1080 @ 2000k bitrate
- 2560x1440 @ 4000k bitrate
- 3840x2160 @ 6000k bitrate (HDR)

#### Portrait Videos:
- Same quality levels with adjusted resolutions based on aspect ratio

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema
```python
# Core Tables:
CompressionJob     # Job tracking and metadata
VideoFile         # Individual video file records  
CompressionTask   # Video + quality combinations
SystemMetrics     # Resource usage history

# Relationships:
Job -> Videos -> Tasks
Job -> Metrics
```

### CRUD Services Layer
```python
CompressionJobService    # Job lifecycle management
VideoFileService        # Video metadata operations
CompressionTaskService  # Task progress tracking
SystemMetricsService    # Resource monitoring data
CRUDService            # Combined service layer
```

### Resource Monitoring System
```python
class ResourceMonitor:
    - cpu_threshold: 80%      # Reduce workers above this
    - memory_threshold: 80%   # Reduce workers above this  
    - min_concurrent: 1       # Minimum workers
    - max_concurrent: 4       # Maximum workers (CPU cores limited)
```

### Concurrent Processing Flow
1. **Database Job Creation**: Create job record with metadata
2. **Task Creation**: Each video + quality combination becomes a tracked task
3. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Manages concurrent ffmpeg processes
4. **Progress Updates**: Real-time database updates for job progress
5. **System Metrics**: Continuous resource monitoring storage
6. **Error Handling**: Database-tracked failure states and error messages

### Thread Safety & Database Integration
- **GUI Updates**: Uses `root.after()` for thread-safe GUI updates
- **Database Operations**: Thread-safe CRUD operations with session management
- **Logging**: Thread-safe logging system with database storage
- **Resource Updates**: Separate monitoring thread storing metrics in database

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Adjusting Concurrent Workers
Edit the `ResourceMonitor` class to customize:
```python
self.max_concurrent = min(multiprocessing.cpu_count(), 6)  # Increase max workers
self.cpu_threshold = 70  # More aggressive CPU management
```

### Custom Quality Profiles
Modify the quality arrays in `_run_compression()` method to add/remove quality levels.

## üö¶ Performance Optimization

### System Resource Guidelines:
- **Light Load** (CPU < 60%, Memory < 60%): Full concurrent workers
- **Medium Load** (CPU 60-80%, Memory 60-80%): Reduced workers  
- **Heavy Load** (CPU > 80%, Memory > 80%): Minimum workers (1-2)

### Best Practices:
1. **SSD Storage**: Use SSD for input/output folders for better I/O performance
2. **Close Other Apps**: Free up system resources before large batch processing
3. **Monitor Temperatures**: Ensure adequate cooling for sustained processing
4. **Batch Size**: Process in smaller batches if system becomes unstable

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **FFmpeg Not Found**: Ensure FFmpeg is in system PATH
2. **High Resource Usage**: Application automatically manages this, but manual intervention available via Stop button
3. **GUI Freezing**: All processing is done in background threads - GUI should remain responsive
4. **Memory Leaks**: Process monitoring helps prevent excessive memory usage

### Error Handling:
- Individual task failures don't stop the entire batch
- Detailed error logging for each failed compression
- Graceful degradation when system resources are constrained

## üìà Performance Benefits

### Before (Sequential Processing):
- Process videos one at a time
- User waits for entire queue
- Underutilized system resources
- No resource awareness

### After (Concurrent Processing):
- **3-5x faster processing** on multi-core systems
- **Immediate start** - no waiting in queue
- **Intelligent resource management**
- **Better user experience** with real-time feedback
- **Scalable performance** based on system capabilities

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- GPU acceleration support
- Network/cloud processing capabilities  
- Priority queue system
- Resume interrupted batches
- Advanced scheduling options
